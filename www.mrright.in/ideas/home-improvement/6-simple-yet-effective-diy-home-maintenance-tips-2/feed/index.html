		<description><![CDATA[Great list! I don&#039;t like to spend large amounts of money to get professionals to do a job that I could do myself. I actually already follow a lot of these tips at home and I can see how effective they are! I&#039;d like to add a tip of my own. When it comes to getting rid of difficult stains or marks on a tiled surface either in the bathroom or kitchen, I find that what works best is a rapid action degreasing solution. It&#039;s important to use the right product otherwise it would lead to discolouration. I usually use Roff Cera Clean since it’s a high-quality solution and has proven results.]]></description>
