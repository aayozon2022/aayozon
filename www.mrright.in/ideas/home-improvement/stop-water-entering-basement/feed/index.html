		<description><![CDATA[If your downspouts are dumping water less than 5 feet from your house, use plastic or metal gutter extensions to direct the water further out. Extensions, on the other hand, aren&#039;t the most attractive or practical long-term option, especially if you&#039;re prone to tripping over them or running over them with a lawn mower. The permanent underground drain pipe is unseen and capable of transporting significant amounts of gutter runoff far away from your home.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My dad told me that he would like to repair his basement so that he can rent it and make some extra money since he lives alone. I like how you said that if you waterproof your basement then the chances of watering entering will be lowered by a great degree. I will tell my dd to contact a professional so that the basement can get properly repaired and that way he can rent it sooner.]]></description>
