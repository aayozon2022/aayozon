		<description><![CDATA[I had no idea that you should make sure that all of your plugs have three prongs because if they don&#039;t they might not be grounded. My sister is looking to get some help with her electricity because it was turning off and on randomly. It could be really nice for her to be able to get a professional to take a look at her power grid.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for suggesting that its best to have your outlets replaced if they don&#039;t have a third prong ground. My cousin lives in an older house, and all oh his plugs have two-prong grounded plugs. We will immediately contact an electrician to help my cousin replace all of his plugs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for pointing out that unexpected flickering lights can be an indication of an electrical problem, and may mean you need to call an electrician. My husband and I have been experiencing this recently and, since we&#039;re pretty sure it&#039;s not ghosts, we probably need to call an electrician. I think that having a reliable source of electricity is something that it&#039;s nice we don&#039;t generally have to think about, and knowing someone who can help you restore that when you do have to think about it is comforting.]]></description>
