		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m glad you said to clean out any plants or anything that&#039;s blocking the area so you can work freely. You want to be able to see what you&#039;re doing when you&#039;re installing or replacing a pump. Any wrong move could be disastrous. It might be helpful to hire someone to do this for me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s good to know that you might need a new water pump installed if you have a shortage of water in your home. My brother has been telling me how he isn&#039;t getting as much water as he used to, and he wants to know what he can do to rectify that. I&#039;ll pass this information along to him so that he can look further into his options for water pump installation.]]></description>
