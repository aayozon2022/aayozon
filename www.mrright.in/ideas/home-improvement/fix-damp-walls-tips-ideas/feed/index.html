		<description><![CDATA[Condensation is one of the most simple damp issue to solve. It is often fixed easily and cheaply without the need of professional assistance.

The improvement of your home&#039;s ventilation could aid in clearing condensation completely. Some effective strategies include:

1. Opening windows more often and letting your home breathe. If your windows can be locked partially This is a fantastic idea.

2. Get a dehumidifier and leave it on for a few hours each day.

3. Instead of quickly heating your home to the highest temperature, turn your boiler on the lower setting to last for longer.

4. In more extreme conditions, it is possible to install positive ventilation.]]></description>

My brother is thinking about hiring a rising damp treatment specialist next week because he&#039;s noticed steamed windows in his basement and doesn&#039;t want mold to grow. It seems like a good investment to hire a reputable professional that can help him identify the cause of the condensation and then repair it before further damage takes place.]]></description>
