		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing great thoughts on different types of countertops.  For me, I would highly recommend quartz countertop.  I&#039;ve been using it for almost five years now and it still looks as new. It is easy to clean and maintain, specially for me that I love to coke and bake so  I needed a countertop that is durable, heat and stain resistant. By the way, I got mine from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caesarstoneus.com/about-us/information-inspiration/design-to-inspire/quartzite-countertops-vs-quartz-countertops/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Caesarstone&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>
