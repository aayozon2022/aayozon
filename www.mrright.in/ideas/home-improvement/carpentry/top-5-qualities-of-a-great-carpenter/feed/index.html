		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve spoken on the phone with Jim Morgan and I&#039;m just
blown away by his simple and effective strategy to
make money using his basic woodworking skills.

He started his woodworking business with NO capital,
a few shop tools, and a lot of nerve, in a small 
10x20 foot space and grew it into a 1,400 space in 
the first few months while still remaining as a 
one-person business!
