		<description><![CDATA[Great article! I agree with what you said about swimming pools and how they significantly make properties look more luxurious and expensive. It&#039;s not only because that it improves the look of your home or that it&#039;s an additional amenity, but it&#039;s really because pools are expensive to build as well. I&#039;m from Canada and pools can cost you about $45000 on average for a fiberglass pool. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://alpinecredits.ca/cost-of-swimming-pool/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about the prices. Some people even take out loans just to pay for swimming pool constructions, which is a great thing since loans can reduce the financial impact of home improvement as you can borrow money and pay it off in the future, rather than just splurging on a one time payment.]]></description>
