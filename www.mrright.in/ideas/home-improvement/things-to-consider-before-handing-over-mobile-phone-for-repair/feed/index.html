		<description><![CDATA[Look, I wouldn&#039;t take that much risk at all. After all, there is very important data, for example, bank cards, contacts and all that. When I had to take the phone in for repair, I even Googled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nection.io/posts/how-to-transfer-contacts-from-phone-to-sim-card-on-samsung&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;how to transfer contacts from phone to sim card on samsung&lt;/a&gt; so that there was no information left on the phone. It&#039;s easier for me to install everything again than to deal with the consequences.]]></description>

The design is flawed and the operating system is horrible - Apple is on my top 10 garbage list for 2021 - what a joke!]]></description>
