		<description><![CDATA[There is no continuity between the hot and neutral when I turn on the switch. It&#039;s as though there&#039;s a snag in the system. This is when things start to get strange. I have sporadic continuity when I connect my hot and neutral to my VOM and then manually spin the motor. Each turn will provide a short burst of continuity as long as I&#039;m in one of the three &quot;on&quot; positions. When I try to dial in the exact location of the motor where the continuity happened, however, the continuity vanishes. Even if it&#039;s only at extremely low RPMs, the motor must be rotating.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I went ahead and energized the fan to 110v. It works
 So, I guess it had something to do with the variable speed setup. Not sure, but since it works, that&#039;s what matters.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been troubleshooting a small Westinghouse fan/light. I was told that the light didn&#039;t work. But after tracing and remaking all the connections, the light does indeed work.
The fan, however, does not. When I engage the switch there is no continuity between the hot and the neutral. It&#039;s like there&#039;s an open wire somewhere. This is where it gets weird. If I connect my hot and neutral to my VOM, and THEN spin the motor manually, I get intermittent continuity. So long as I&#039;m in one of the 3 &quot;on&quot; positions, each revolution will produce a short burst of continuity. If, however, I try to dial in the actual position of the motor where the continuity occurred, the continuity disappears. The motor has to be spinning, even if that&#039;s only very very very low RPMs.]]></description>
