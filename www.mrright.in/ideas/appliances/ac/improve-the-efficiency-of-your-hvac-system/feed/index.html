		<description><![CDATA[i really enjoyed reading this article about How to improve the efficiency of your HVAC system and these tips like Change AC filter:
Some dust and dirt can accumulate in the AC filter when used regularly. It increases the workload of your AC causing a decrease in efficiency and/or its breakdown. Remember to regularly check the filter and change it every 1-2 months. It helps in improving the air quality, increasing efficiency, and reducing wear and tear to your AC unit, thus also increasing its life span, thanks for sharing]]></description>
