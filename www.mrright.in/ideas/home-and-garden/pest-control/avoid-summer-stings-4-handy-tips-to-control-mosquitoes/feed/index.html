Ideally, the mosquito problems and in general, the household susceptibility to insects should be better controlled. Still, vector-borne diseases related with insect bites are spiralling out of control in urban &#038; rural areas.

Scientifically-relevant and practical options, like BugShield Clothing, are worthy of a consideration. These insect-repellant clothes envelope the wearer, keeping away the most deadly insects. Without the chemical traces of bug sprays or the risk of children poking into an electrical mosquito-killer, this line of protective clothing is comfortable and available for all age-groups!]]></description>
