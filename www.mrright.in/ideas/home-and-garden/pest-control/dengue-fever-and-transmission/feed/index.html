		<description><![CDATA[Interesting Facts About Dengue

Dengue does not spread through human contact, rather it spreads when bitten by the carrier mosquito, the female Aedes mosquito. This mosquito is known to bite during the daytime and its favorite spots to bite are below the elbow and the knee.
Dengue is not fatal if identified early and treated well.

Dengue is found in most parts of the world, but it is more commonly reported in tropical and subtropical regions. Severe dengue is one of the leading causes of serious illnesses and death in children in Asia and Latin America.

Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever is caused by a certain strain of the dengue virus. It causes the platelet count to drop drastically resulting in severe bleeding and a drop in blood pressure. This may also lead to shock and death.

When a pregnant woman is infected with dengue fever, she can pass on the infection to the baby during childbirth.

When infected with dengue, the patient should not take aspirin or other painkillers. Both dengue and aspirin have deleterious effects on the latelet counts and so the hemorrhagic process may get hastened
