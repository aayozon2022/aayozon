		<description><![CDATA[Great article! It is really important to do all of those steps that you mentioned above. Common cold can be very hard to treat sometimes and can feel nasty. I would just like to add a little more to your point about a healthy diet. It is important to eat food that is very rich in nutrients to boost your immune system. Common colds can easily make someone bed-bound if the immune system is weak. Vitamin C is the best nutrient, that can help to fight against the common cold. Food like tomatoes, strawberries, and oranges have a lot of vitamin C. Supplements are also a good suggestion, especially if it is hard to get certain meals that have a lot of vitamin C. Visit https://actimore.com/ for a vast amount of supplements, there are also cool vitamin C products there.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A good classification essay should be as clear as its introduction. This is because the purpose of the conclusion is to wrap up the whole text and draw conclusions. It is not a good idea to introduce new ideas or arguments in the concluding paragraph.Visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://essaymap.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://essaymap.org/&lt;/a&gt; for more details. The point of a classification essay is to make your reader understand the topic. If you do not have any ideas to share, then it is better to skip it. It&#039;s also important to choose a topic that is appropriate for your grade level.]]></description>
