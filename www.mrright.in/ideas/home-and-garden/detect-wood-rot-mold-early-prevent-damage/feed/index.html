		<description><![CDATA[Your blog is very helpful as I got to know how I can detect wood rot at my house. I was really worried about watching my ceiling rot every next day. Not only this, but living in Florida also offers your house a big issue, and that is black molds. To take care of this I hired a service for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.miamibeachcarpetcleaningfl.com/mold-remediation.asp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;mold removal in Miami Beach, FL&lt;/a&gt;. Hippo carpet cleaners here are the best because not only their pricing is very affordable but their service is very quick. They treat it as an emergency because they don&#039;t want their clients to fall for breathing problems.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great! It is easy to spot the differences between mold and wood rot. Wood rot presents as decay, and mold presents as discoloration, usually black or white. Wood rot is a dangerous but avoidable condition often found in the wood of older houses.
