		<description><![CDATA[There is another way to keep Mosquitoes away from your house. You can use Camphor as a mosquito repellant. Scientifically known as Cinnamomum Camphora, Camphor is harvested from camphor trees and later processed through steam distillation. Camphor belongs to the Laurel family, which is scientifically known as Ocotea Usambarensis. The chemical formula of this naturally occurring organic substance is C₁₀H₁₆O. A major source of camphor in Asia is camphor basil. With a melting point of 175 °C, camphor is used mainly for its scent. Camphor is used in the medical industry as an antibacterial, antifungal and anti-inflammatory. Camphor can also be used as a natural insecticide and germicide. If your home is plagued by mosquitoes during the monsoons, camphor tablets and air purifiers can help tackle this issue. Camphor tablets can obliterate cockroaches, moths and other insects that pose a threat to your health and wardrobe. One of the leading brands that have managed to efficiently capture the miraculous qualities of camphor in their products is Mangalam Campure. Campure products are great products when it comes to improving health of your house. To know more about their products http://campure.in/]]></description>
