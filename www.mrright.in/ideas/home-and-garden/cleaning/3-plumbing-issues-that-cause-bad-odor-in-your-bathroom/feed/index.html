		<description><![CDATA[I wonder if there are any cracked or loose pipes in the building that I work at. It sounds like that may be the problems since they do tend to keep the bathroom pretty clean all the time. I&#039;m not too sure since I&#039;m not an expert but I would think it&#039;s that or there&#039;s a problem with the sewer. I just hope that they fix the problem soon.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for sharing this helpful article about plumbing. My bathroom was not smelling very good so I scrubbed every surface to see if the smell would go away. I even sprayed some cleaner down the drain because I think that is where the smell was coming from. However, by bathroom still smells. I might need to call a plumber to see if there is anything wrong with the pipes.]]></description>
